# E203: slice notation whitespace
# E501: line length
# W503: line break before binary operator
# W504: line break after binary operator
# F841: local variable name is assigned to but never used
# E231: false positives from colon-format specifiers inside f-strings
#       (we use format width/precision in test/perf strings, e.g. `{time:7.3f}`)
# W604: backticks used in docstrings for inline code examples; pyflakes
#       warns about deprecated backtick usage but project keeps these docs.
